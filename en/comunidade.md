# üåê Community

### Shall we create a community together? <a href="#shall-we-create-a-community-together" id="shall-we-create-a-community-together"></a>

The objective of this experiment is to create a community, but I alone will not create anything. A community is created from the interaction and engagement of its members. The idea of having a community that helps members understand and experience web3 strikes me as very exciting. My intention is just to help with kick-starting to create a safe learning environment, where everyone helps each other.

The goal behind this experiment is not to create a DAO, much less a company. To be part of the community, you don't have to commit to working hours or specific responsibilities, although you can really make the effort and make a huge difference to other people's lives. Consider this environment as an experimental lab organized by a group of friends who have the same common goal and are willing to help each other.

### Who is it for? <a href="#who-is-it-for" id="who-is-it-for"></a>

This program is for anyone, although the web3dev community is designed for tech people, you don't have to be or want to be a programmer.

In fact, you don't need to understand anything at all. If you follow the tutorial, you will be able to learn.

The focus is for you to learn how to be a **web3 user**.

### How does it work? <a href="#how-does-it-work" id="how-does-it-work"></a>

I am developing the first missions of the experiment. Each mission is a task that requires learning and execution. Upon completing the quest, you‚Äôll earn some $MELK tokens.

Anyone can participate! No prerequisites or prior knowledge are required.

The purpose of the $MELK token is to create a digital currency in a virtual economy where anyone will be free to experience web3 with ease, without having to spend real money.

### What will I do with my $MELK? <a href="#what-will-i-do" id="what-will-i-do"></a>

At the end of the first module comprising the first 10 lessons, you will be able to use your MELK tokens to buy a personalized NFT, which proves that you have completed the missions and learned the basics of web3.

This NFT will be proof that you are prepared for the world of web3. You will be able to put it on your CV or Linkedin.

As we can recall, the MELK token has no intrinsic value. It has a single objective: to encourage the creation of a community, which can eventually become very strong, of people interested in making web3 a reality for the mainstream (population in general).

Over time and with the growth of the community, we will start to bring more utilities to the token, the NFT and the ecosystem. It is possible that we partner with some company that wants to offer some freebies or exclusive access to those who own the NFT.

But none of this is a promise! It may also happen that we end the experiment after a few months. The most important thing here is that we learn and help each other. Earning the token is a consequence, which may eventually become financially interesting.

### How to participate? <a href="#how-to-paticipate" id="how-to-paticipate"></a>

To participate you need to log into a Discord server where the project is running. Here is the list of possible communities to join:

| Community         | Access Link                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| web3dev           | [https://discord.gg/B85d25rDUT](https://discord.gg/B85d25rDUT) |
| Bankless BR DAO   | [https://discord.gg/hJ7qSyfvqF](https://discord.gg/hJ7qSyfvqF) |
| NFT Gamer         | [https://discord.gg/wytCaHqt3y](https://discord.gg/wytCaHqt3y) |

| DGAC              | [https://discord.gg/NEkCVZa9cm](https://discord.gg/NEkCVZa9cm) |

\
Once inside the Discord server, search for the `üéì | Learn-to-Earn` area and then go to the `üëâ„Éªstart here` channel.

In this channel you will find more information about the experiment and the way to carry out the missions. The missions will require you to send information to a certain channel on Discord and all of them will automatically airdrop your tokens.

\
If you have any questions, the `üí¨„Éªchat` channel is the place to go for help.

That's it! I think with this information, you're ready to venture into the missions we've prepared and start your web3 journey.
