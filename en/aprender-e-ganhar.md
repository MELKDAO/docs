# Learn and Earn?

Yes, that's right. With this experiment you will learn and earn tokens at the same time. The main objective of the $MELK token is to make web3 a reality in Brazil and for that we need to bring as many people to this world as possible. In this experiment, we are going to teach anyone how to participate in the web3 world, learn what a DAO is and even learn how to make money working remotely, freely for a DAO.

The more you evolve and learn, the more tokens you will earn. At first, the $MELK token has no monetary value, but it can be used to buy an NFT that will have social and reputational value for being a proof of learning.

This model is called Learn-to-earn, which means you need to learn first to earn later. It is an innovative teaching model that emerged with the advent of cryptocurrencies. In Brazil, it is not yet widespread and the $MELK token is the first Brazilian Learn-to-earn token.

When you start to learn and receive the token, youâ€™ll be part of history, in the chapter of the web3 revolution, and you will also gain knowledge that few people in the world have.
