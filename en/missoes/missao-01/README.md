description: Create a wallet on Metamask
---

# Mission 1

The first mission to start your web3 journey is to create a crypto wallet. Just like having a bank account where you keep your money, make and receive payments, your crypto wallet is where you’ll handle your tokens. The wallet is a program that you install on your computer, usually as a browser plugin. The wallet that we are going to install is the most popular one, it’s called Metamask and you can install it on Chrome, Firefox, Brave or Edge.

The wallet is a set of private and public keys that you use to receive tokens over the Blockchain. When creating your wallet, within Metamask you will have access to the public address that you will inform other people in order to receive a token and also the keywords that correspond to the private key, which allows the token manipulation in your wallet. The private key and passwords must never be shared with anyone and must be kept in writing in a safe place. Anyone who has access to these words will be able to steal all your coins.

Your wallet will also be used to login and access web3 systems.
