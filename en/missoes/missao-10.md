# Mission 10

Learning to mint and obtain an NFT.

Congratulations! You've reached the last mission of our first module! We learned a lot, from installing Metamask and creating our wallet to doing more complex swap transactions and creating proposals on Snapshost. Incredible! It was quite a journey.

On behalf of the Project Melk team, I would like to thank you for participating in all the missions, contributing to the growth of the project through feedback, suggestions and constructive criticism.

In today's mission, we will understand a little more about what an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is and mint our certificate of completion for this first module. Let’s go?

# 1. Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

NFTs are hard things to describe. So let's break this definition into two parts. First, let's understand what a token is.

In the financial and cryptocurrency market, a token represents a digital asset. And this, for example, is the case of the MELK token. However, the Melk token is a fungible asset, as it can be exchanged for another of the same value. A good analogy is money, which is a fungible good, as one hundred dollar bill can be exchanged for two fifty bills, since they "keep" the same value, they are of the same type.

In the case of NFTs, they are non-fungible tokens, which means they cannot be exchanged or replaced with others of the same type. For NFTs, we can use the Mona Lisa painting analogy. Even if the frame is replicated or copied, there is only one authentic frame.

In this context, NFTs are digital goods that represent a single asset, stored on the blockchain, using the ERC-721 standard in their smart contract. They have traits, which are attributes that can represent anything the developer chooses. In addition, NFTs can also display images, videos, and GIFs. Our NFT will be a course completion certificate with an image containing the student's name and the module they completed.

So the certificate you will mint is a unique digital asset that represents the completion of the first module. NFTs in general can be exchanged, and are often sold for tokens or cash, but in the case of our certificate, the image will specify the student and course the NFT refers to, so exchanging certificates makes no sense, preventing people who have not completed the module from having a certificate.

### 1.1 NFT Collections

A set of NFTs from the same contract is part of a collection. Collections contain different attributes and images, but belong to the same contract. There are several types of collections, and the most famous are the PFPs collections, which stands for Profile Pictures, which are collections of images that can be used as a profile on social networks. A well-known example is the Bored Ape Yatch Club collection:

Bored Apes Yacht Club

This famous NFT collection has revolutionized the way NFTs are used and sold. Collections can have different purposes, as in the case of the Bored Apes, serving as an entrance to a club, a community. Another example is the collections of stores like Adidas, which distribute discounts and specific content to holders of their tokens.

Our NFT collection has a slightly different purpose. Validate the effort, learning and knowledge of each of you. And this collection is for our first learning module, and you will be the first to own Project Melk NFTs! Cool, huh?

You will be able to use the NFT from our collection as proof of knowledge and you can even put it on your CV and LinkedIn profile.

# 2. Marketplaces

Tokens may or may not have monetary value. In the previous example, the BAYCs collection is sold at varying prices depending on the attributes of each token. For example, a Bored Ape NFT where the monkey has the red hat attribute may be more expensive than one with the sunglasses attribute, depending on the rarity of the attributes. That's why there are Marketplaces, which are like NFT markets.

In these markets, whoever owns the NFT can put it up for sale for whatever amount they want, and other people can buy it or not, depending, as mentioned earlier, on the attributes and value the buyer places on the token.

However, marketplaces are also useful for viewing the NFTs you own, even if they have no monetary value, like our certificate NFT, which we take as proof of knowledge.

# 3. Getting to know Opensea

In this part of the mission, we are going to visit a very famous marketplace, OpenSea. There we will learn how to view NFTs, to later view our certificate. To get started, go to this link: [https://opensea.io/](https://opensea.io/)

OpenSea is an NFT marketplace, where we can view countless tokens and even buy them. For today's mission, let's look at some already minted certificates from our MELK project collection.

# 4. Submitting the Mission Proof

In this mission, the order of events will be slightly different. In order for us to verify that you have completed all the missions and enable the mint of your certificate, it is necessary to complete the mission and submit the proof on discord before the mint process. To do this, send the link of an NFT from our collection of your choice in the mission 10 discord chat channel.

First, follow this link:

Now, type MELK DAO Basic Course in the search field, to search our collection:

Your screen should look like this:

On this screen, we can see the various NFTs in our collection. Note that each one has a name: Melk DAO Expert - username on discord.

Now, choose some NFT from our collection and click on it, as pointed out above. Your screen should look like this:

Let's notice a few things on the screen above. At first glance, we can see some basic elements, such as the collection name, in blue, the NFT name (marked in red) just below the collection name, the price history (which should be empty, as our NFT does not have monetary value) and the image, with all the user data. Your NFT will be like that too!

Let's scroll down a bit:

We can see the description of the collection, flagged above. Just below, we have a very important part of our NFT: the properties.

Properties are used to differentiate NFTs in addition to their address. They can be game stats (like health, power, or other things). In the case of our collection, we have some default properties (also called traits) like the DAO link, the melk DAO website and the authors github. However, the mint date, token number, address, and discord user properties are unique. This means that your NFT will have your information and will be unique.

### 4.1 Sending the link on discord

To submit proof of mission 10, copy the link of the NFT you were reviewing, as shown below:

Then send the link on the mission 10 discord chat channel and that's it! You will now be added to our NFT whitelist.

A whitelist is a list of users who can mint the NFT. This means that if you didn't send the link on the mission 10 discord chat channel, you won't be able to perform the mint operation.

You will not receive any Melk tokens in this mission, but proof is required for the bot to add your address to a list of users that can mint.

# 5. Minting the NFT

Now, let's start the mint process of our NFT certificate. For this, we built a special website to carry out this mint.

Follow this link:

Note that in the upper right corner, we have a button to connect the wallet. To carry out the process correctly, connect your wallet - the same used in all missions - on our website, as we have done in other situations:

Then, carefully read the text regarding the minting, as essential information about the process is described, such as the need for two transactions.

Remember that for minting operations, you need the number of Melk tokens defined and the completion of all missions, in addition to the same wallet with which you carried out the missions. Let's understand the NFT minting process.

First, let's verify that your whitelist is complete. After connecting the wallet, click on the “Check Whitelist” button.

Upon clicking, the screen will load until the verification is completed. When it is complete, the website will alert you whether you are whitelisted or not and provide you with the “Approve” button. If you are not on the whitelist, please wait a few minutes and try again, as the transaction may take a while depending on network congestion.

Now, let's perform an operation called Approve. This transaction references the MELK token contract. This makes you allow our smart contract to spend your Melk tokens. The contract will do this at the time of minting the NFT. To approve, click on the button that appeared right after checking the whitelist:

Once the approval transaction is confirmed and mined, we can proceed with minting, similar to whitelisting verification. Minting is a smart contract interaction transaction, so your Melk tokens are spent in exchange for an NFT certificate.

Remember: Melk tokens spent on NFT do not return to your wallet. We must also remember that the Approval transaction only allows access to MELK tokens from your wallet, and no other.

To mint, click the “Mint” button and confirm the transaction. Remember to check the details before approving the transaction.

Now, let's wait for the mining and confirmation on the minting blockchain. In the meantime, let's open OpenSea to view your new certificate. First, follow this link:

In order for us to see the NFT on our profile, we first need to connect our wallet. Click the "Connect" button above and complete the steps below.

After connecting the wallet, let's click on your profile:

Please note that we have some information such as your address, the date you joined OpenSea, the NFTs you created, collected and bookmarked. If the page is not selected in “Collected”, click on the category, as in the screenshot above.

In the “Collected” tab, one more NFT should appear. Yes, your certificate! The name should be Melk DAO Expert - your discord name. Let's click on the NFT:

Here you can see all the information explained above, but with your data.

If your NFT is not showing, follow the steps below.

### 5.1 My NFT is not showing up!

This is an issue that may occur due to NFT metadata, which may not have been loaded or not yet been interpreted by OpenSea. To resolve this issue, click on the “Refresh Metadata” button, shown in the screenshot below (still on your NFT screen).

This option will reload the NFT metadata and update it in OpenSea. Wait a minute or two and refresh the page. The image and properties should be working normally.

# 6. Congratulations!

Congratulations! You have completed the Melk Project basic course! We went through various missions and rewards together, and we hope you learned basic concepts and practices common in the Web3 universe. We want to thank you for all this learning journey, for the project suggestions and feedback, and especially for finishing all the missions with us!

We look forward to seeing you in the next modules. Thank you!
