# Mission 8

In the last missions we learned to do several new things, and more and more we are mastering basic concepts of web3. In today's mission, we will learn how to create a USDC transfer transaction using the resulting swap balance from the past mission.

## 1. Aspects of a transfer

The transfers, like the rewards of each mission, are irreversible, that is, after confirmation and registration on the blockchain, it is not possible to reverse the transaction. Therefore, it is very important to double check that the recipient’s address and amount are correct before making transfers.

For example, if a malicious hacker breaks into a system and has access and the power to make transfers to himself, it will be possible to view all malicious transactions and locate where the stolen money is (at which wallet address). However, the transactions cannot be reversed, as the theft will already be recorded on the blockchain. Therefore, it is very important to check what type of transaction you are carrying out.

Transfers involve gas costs, fees that are paid to mining nodes to make a transaction happen. When we talk about MATIC transfers, the cost is lower than transfers that interact with smart contracts. This is because there are additional costs when interacting with the smart contract code as they are more complex operations than a transfer of the native currency of the blockchain being used. In other words, transferring MATIC on Polygon or ETH on Ethereum, for example, is cheaper than transferring any other token from these networks.

Generally, gas fees for transacting on Polygon are negligible. At the time of writing, the fee to transfer 1 MATIC is 0.000674MATIC, which equates to approximately 0.004 BRL (0.4 BRL cents, i.e. less than one cent).

## 2. Project Donation and Prosperity

For today's mission, we will swap at least 1 USDC that we obtained in the previous mission by swapping on Uniswap. This amount was converted to approximately 5.00 BRL at the time the mission was published. This transfer will be made to the project's BOT wallet as a donation.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Heads up!** By carrying out this mission you will be transferring your real money to the project's BOT. That is, you will be making a donation to the project. This donation is irreversible, we will not refund this money later. Proceed only if you are comfortable making this payment.
{% endhint %}

As we explained earlier, every transaction requires a gas fee. So far, we have paid all fees for all transfers of MELK Reward Tokens to you for missions performed. This cost came out of our pocket as a form of investment for your learning so far.

This money that we will receive from you in this mission will be used to pay the transaction fees for the next users of the project. In this way, this donation of yours will help more people to carry out missions and also learn everything you have already learned and will also help the project to thrive.

We consider this the best way to be able to give everyone the opportunity to give something back and actively participate in the success of our mission, which is to bring thousands of people to the new web3 world.

By completing this specific mission, you will not only be learning, but effectively helping others in this chain of good that has been structured using blockchain and smart contracts.

## 3. Sending USDC

To get started, open the Metamask Chrome extension.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

Your MATIC balance will appear in the middle of the screen, like mine above, and your USDC balance just below it under “Assets”. Click on “USDC”:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (73).png>)

Your screen should look like this, with a balance of approximately 2 USDC (which we got in the previous mission).

Just below the balance we have two buttons: “Send” and “Swap”. Click the “Submit” button, and your screen will look like this:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png>)

Your screen should look something like this, apart from “Recents”.

This is where you will enter the address that will receive the USDC. For this mission, copy the address below and paste it into the “Send To” field.

{% hint style="success" %}
0xdfac3c76f4751c536295881ec377290d1da7a469
{% endhint %}

This address corresponds to the wallet address of the BOT that sends the MELK Experiment rewards. As written above, the USDC received will be converted and used to pay gas fees on each transaction for future users.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (81).png>)

Now enter the amount of USDC to send. For this transaction, we will send at least 1 USDC.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you think your learning so far is worth more than that, feel free to transfer a greater amount. The greater the amount we receive as a donation, the more people we will be able to reach and bring to the web3 world.
{% endhint %}

After entering the amount, click “Next”.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png>)

Here we can read more details about the transaction. After reading and confirming the amounts, click “Confirm”.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)

The transaction may take a while to mine depending on network congestion, but once created, it will appear like this in your wallet.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

Click on the transaction to see more details. In the popup that opens, click “View on Block Explorer” to open in Polygonscan:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (52).png>)

This screen is already familiar to you, as seen in Mission 3. As we see in the example screenshot, our transfer transaction has been successfully confirmed!

For this mission, post the transaction hash on discord to receive your reward!

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that the MELKs reward will be very important for you to complete the last mission and earn your NFT, which is a proof of learning.
{% endhint %}

## 4. All ready! Now post the transaction hash on discord!

Go to the MELK Experiment Mission 8 channel on discord and send the transaction hash to earn 10 MELK.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example in my case the transaction hash is 0x34a41d0422b5fcea45bc17d4b4c6aeaf0f86b6c370f1691ae705ebdf2f8cfb4c
{% endhint %}

Congratulations! You learned how to make a real USDC transaction. In the next mission we will learn how to sign a snapshot vote.

We are very close to the end. There are only 2 missions left for you to complete this module and earn an exclusive NFT from the first Learn-to-Earn project in Brazil. Keep up the good work and soon you will be part of a select group of people who will make the history of web3 in Brazil and in the world!

I hope you are really enjoying this journey. Remember to invite all friends to learn together and prepare for the next financial revolution.
