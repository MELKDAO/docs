# Web3Dev

The MelkBot project is an initiative that originated within the [Web3Dev](https://www.web3dev.com.br/) community (a community of developers interested in programming in web3 technologies). Specifically, the project is developed within the Learn-to-Earn Pod, which started its activities in late March 2022 with the sole purpose of maintaining the Melk Experiment project.
